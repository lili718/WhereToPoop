<h3>Features Section</h3>
<p>The Features section displays the Where to Poop map and provides basic information about the app's services</p>
<p>The first thing you will see is the map.  The map has icons on it indicating which different types of bathrooms are available.  An icon that looks like a man indicates a men's bathroom is present there.  An icon that looks like a woman indicates that a women's bathroom is available there.  An icon that looks like a baby indicates that baby changing facilities are available.  An icon that looks like both the male and female symbols indicates a gender neutral bathroom.</p>
