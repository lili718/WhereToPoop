<h2>About:</h2>
<p>Our project, Where to Poop, was created by five Drexel College of Computing and Informatics students to help people find toilets when they need them.  Since our tagline is, "Yelp for Toilets," we include ways to rate toilets and to find toilets based on your own preferences and needs.  Toilets can easily be added to the map by filling out a simple form, and once your added toilet is ready, we'll alert you that it's on the map.</p>
<p>This project is licensed under the MIT License in order to allow as many people as possible to benefit from our project.  That said, the Google Maps API used in this product also has its own terms and conditions which need respecting if you are modifying this project to suit your own needs.</p>

<p>Thank you for using our app and please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
