Internal Documentation for Where to Poop Gitlab

Where to Poop is a web application that helps users find toilets near them.

For internal use only.

Currently, the codebase is not set up to be deployed.  The entire working website 
at one time will be stored within the html folder.  Other folders may exist to help 
organize individual portions of the project, but they will be deleted when no 
longer needed and when the components within have been placed in an appropriate 
location in the html folder.

To change the codebase:

If you are putting together a component of the project that is not yet ready for 
deployment, having its own file or folder outside of the html folder is acceptable.  
Files must have a clear, descriptive name and an appropriate commit message 
explaining the latest revisions.  Once the component is complete, the files should 
be moved into the html folder, where further updates will be documented through 
commit messages and comments within the code.

To deploy the codebase:

Until our codebase is set up in such a manner that it can be deployed as a full 
website, each file must currently be run individually from your local repository.  
Update your local repository through a git merge or a git pull, then make the 
appropriate changes in the file pathways to dependencies (for example, image 
links), so that those items will display from the appropriate location on your 
computer.
